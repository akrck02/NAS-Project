# Storage

Okay today is a new day, so I grabbed a coffee and starting testing things. ☕️

## RAID

RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks and is a way to handle multiple disks acting like one. There are many types of RAID systems with better performance or better data loss management. In this case, I won’t be using any RAID because I only have a disk connected, but I will do it once I get a better PC to use as a NAS / server and a bunch of disks. 

## Solving permissions issues

I created a folder named Test inside the nas Family disk and a file  with “Hello world” inside using the built in ssh.

I checkout the permissions of the directory from my fedora laptop, results here: 

![permissions](Storage/permissions1.png)

 

Seems like we don’t have any permision from outsite, so I will check them from the NAS:

![permissions](Storage/permissions2.png)

Okay it seems that no write permissions are shown, let’s dive in.

### Testing USB drives

I want my NAS to share the usb drives that are connected into the laptop to the rest of the network so I modify the smb.conf file.

```bash
[Media]
  comment = NAS storage USB media.
  path = /media/
	browseable = true
  writeable = yes
  create mask = 0775
  directory mask = 0775
  write list = nas-admin		
```

So now I have total access to my USB HDD.
